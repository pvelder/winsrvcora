Current open issues
-------------------

- when starting the service using the "debug" command it can not be interrupted using ctrl-c
- when starting the service using (1) install followed by (2) run, the service remains in status "starting"  (related to the previous point?)
- config.toml is currentlky expected in the same directory, where the service commands are executed
